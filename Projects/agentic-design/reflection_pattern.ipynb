       "Overall, your implementation looks clean and correct. Here are some minor critiques and suggestions for improvement:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Docstring formatting**: In the docstrings, the parameter descriptions and return types are not formatted according to Python conventions. You can use the triple quotes `\"\"\"...\"\"\"` to format the docstrings correctly.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Type hints**: It's a good practice to add type hints for function parameters and return types. This makes the code more readable and helps with static type checking.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Variable naming**: The variable names `left` and `right` are concise, but `mid_left` and `mid_right` might be more descriptive for the divided halves.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Redundant comments**: Some of the comments, such as `# The merge function takes two sorted arrays as input and merges them into a single sorted array.`, are redundant and can be removed, as the code itself is self-explanatory.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Error handling**: The current implementation assumes that the input `arr` is a list of integers. You might want to add some error handling to ensure that the input is a list and contains only integers. This can be done using `isinstance()` and `all()` functions.\n",
