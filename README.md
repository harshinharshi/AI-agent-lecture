## 🐍 **Phase 1 – Python Foundations (6 hrs)**

🎯 **Goal:** Learn just enough Python to implement AI agents.

1️⃣ **Intro & Setup** – Install Python, VS Code, run your first program, networking.

2️⃣ **Basic Blocks** – Variables, data types, operators, input/output

3️⃣ **Logic Flow** – if-else, loops, pattern printing

4️⃣ **Functions** – Parameters, returns, mini calculator project

5️⃣ **Class Concepts** – Attributes, methods, simple class example

6️⃣ **Mini Project** – Basic message response project using functions and predefined keywords.

7️⃣ Collections Basics – Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries (create, update, iterate).

8️⃣ String Handling – Slicing, formatting (f-strings), common methods.

9️⃣ Error Handling – try-except, raising errors, simple debugging.

🔟 Modules & Imports – Using built-in modules (math, random, datetime).

1️⃣1️⃣ File Handling – Read/write text files, simple log storage.

1️⃣2️⃣ Mini Project – To-do list or contact book using file storage.

## 🤖 **Phase 2 – LLM Basics (3 hrs)**

🎯 **Goal:** Understand LLMs before building agents.

* 🕰 **History & Evolution** – From rule-based to GPT
* ⚙ **How They Work LLM works**
* 🌍 **Popular LLMs** – GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA 
* 🌐 Popular platforms Langchain, Hugging face and groq
* 🐦 LangChain: Chaining & ChatTemplates

## 📂 **Phase 4 – Projects (9 hrs)**

### 🧩 **Major Project Series – Core Agentic Patterns (9 hrs hrs)**

1. 🔄 **Reflection Pattern** – Agent evaluates its own outputs (Optional)
2. 🤝 **Multi-agent supervisor** – Agents collaborating and different Multi-agent architectures
3. 🌐 Customer Support Bot (Optional)
4. 🔬 Deep Research Agent (Optional, with MCP integration)

---
### Optional
*Additional projects and topics will be introduced based on the latest research papers or emerging technologies in the AI agent field during the learning process. These are optional and subject to time availability and the course completion date. Interview preparation and resume discussions may also be included.*
